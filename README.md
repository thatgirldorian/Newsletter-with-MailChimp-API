# Newsletter with MailChimp API
 This is a newsletter that allows people sign up for new recipes and cooking tips. I made it with MailChimp's API and Node js. It also has separate success and failure pages that the user is directed to if they successfully sign up or otherwise. 
 
 I snagged a nice logo off the interwebs and deployed it on Heroku.
